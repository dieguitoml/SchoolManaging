# SchoolManaging

In this project, I developed a software application for managing a school using Java. The software allows users (in this case, children's parents) to view and pay for various school activities directly.

# Key Features:

# Activity Management: 
Parents can view and select activities that the school offers.
# Payment System: 
Parents can pay for activities within the application.
# Software Engineering Process:

# Client Interaction: 
Simulated discussions with the client to gather requirements.
# UML Diagrams:
Created detailed UML diagrams to model the system architecture.
# Implementation:
Implemented the software according to the client's specifications, ensuring that the final product met their needs.

This project encompasses the entire software engineering process, from requirement gathering to the final implementation.
